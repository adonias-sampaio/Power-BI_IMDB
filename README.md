# Power-BI_IMDB

In this dashboard, I sourced the data from Kaggle, which provides a list of the top 250 ranked films on IMDb.

The IMDb Top 250 is one of the most famous and highly-regarded movie rankings globally, created and maintained by the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). It's a list that represents the top-rated 250 feature films based on user ratings.

🎬 Selection Criteria
The movies included in the IMDb Top 250 must meet specific criteria to ensure the quality and scope of the list:

Feature Films Only: The list is limited to theatrical feature films.
Excluded: Short films, TV movies, documentaries, and TV series (IMDb has a separate Top 250 TV list).
Minimum Ratings: A film must receive a minimum number of ratings (currently 25,000 votes) to be eligible for inclusion.
Regular Voter Count: Only the ratings submitted by "regular voters"—users who rate films frequently—are counted towards the ranking. IMDb keeps the exact criteria for a "regular voter" secret to prevent manipulation of the list.
